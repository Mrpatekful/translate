It's not about the money, is it?
It's not an either-or situation.
It's not for the faint of heart.
It's nothing short of a miracle.
It's nothing to get upset about.

It seems that I have lost my keys.
It seems that he knows everything.
It seems to me that you are wrong.
It was a waste time for all of us.
It was almost noon when I woke up.
It was crowded here all last week.
It was just a passing infatuation.
It was obvious that they had lied.
It was proved that he was a thief.
It was quite dark when I got home.
It was supposed to be kept secret.
It was very nice seeing you again.
It wasn't Tom's idea. It was mine.
It wasn't exactly a piece of cake.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
It would be a good idea if I went.
It would be sad if that were true.
It's a bit too complicated for me.
It's a cloak-and-dagger operation.
It's a fairly complicated problem.
It's a magnificent view, isn't it?
It's a matter of vital importance.
It's a wonder they're still awake.
It's about time you got a haircut.
It's already ten o'clock at night.
It's always a pleasure to see you.
