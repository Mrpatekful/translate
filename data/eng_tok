i'm writing a letter .
i'm your best friend .
i'm your biggest fan .
i've already read it .
i've already said no .
i've been there once .
i've brought it back .
i've changed clothes .
i've come a long way .
i've done everything .
i've enjoyed my stay .
i've finished eating .
i've got a good idea .
i've got a pacemaker .
i've got a toothache .
i've got to get home .
i've had a busy week .
i've heard about you .
i've heard it before .
i've heard the rumor .
i've learned to cook .
i've lost my car key .
i've lost my dignity .
i've lost my filling .
i've lost my glasses .
i've made a decision .
i've made up my mind .
i've nothing to give .
i've received it too .
i've told the police .
i've won first prize !
i've worked with tom .
if only he had known !
ignore tom's request .
is tom a good kisser ?
is tom about to sing ?
is tom still playing ?
is anybody listening ?
is anyone else going ?
is flight 23 on time ?
is his pulse regular ?
is it ok if we begin ?
is it difficult work ?
is it hot over there ?
is it money you need ?
is my answer correct ?
is she a pretty girl ?
is she making a doll ?
is that a bus or car ?
is that another joke ?
is that your bicycle ?
is the cat all right ?
is there a timetable ?
is there anyone else ?
is there anyone here ?
is this a compliment ?
is this all for real ?
is this all there is ?
is this beef or pork ?
is this enough money ?
is this good english ?
is this pencil yours ?
is this your bicycle ?
is this your opinion ?
is your trunk locked ?
isn't he a bit young ?
isn't it infuriating ?
isn't that tom's hat ?
isn't this wonderful ?
it affects all of us .
it belongs to me now .
it feels really good .
it felt like a dream .
it glows in the dark .
it has to be removed .
it is a payday today .
it is already eleven .
it is hardly raining .
it is in the kitchen .
it is kind of pretty .
it is no good to you .
it is of great value .
it is out of fashion .
it is to be expected .
it is very cold here .
it is very hot today .
it is wrong to steal .
it looks fascinating .
it looks good on you .
it looks like an egg .
it looks really good .
it makes me so happy .
it may rain tomorrow .
it means a lot to me .
it no longer matters .
it only costs $ 10 . 00 !
it pays to be polite .
it rained for a week .
it really did happen .
it seems interesting .
it seems safe enough .
it sounds good to me .
it tastes just right .
it took half an hour .
it was a false alarm .
it was a good answer .
it was a long letter .
it was a quiet night .
it was a stupid idea .
it was a tedious job .
it was all a big lie .
it was an awful week .
it was awfully funny .
it was disappointing .
it was heart - warming .
it was his best time .
it was his own fault .
it was kind of weird .
it was time to leave .
it went off smoothly .
it will be dark soon .
it would be too easy .
it'll cost me my job .
it's 99 . 9 % effective .
it's a beautiful day !
it's a beautiful job .
it's a complete sham .
it's a dead giveaway .
it's a good question .
it's a monster storm .
it's a piece of cake .
it's a small problem .
it's a waste of time .
it's against the law .
it's all greek to me .
it's all about money .
it's all custom made .
it's all over for us .
it's all so hopeless .
it's all very simple .
it's an easy victory .
it's an extreme case .
it's as easy as that .
it's been a good day .
it's best not to ask .
it's common courtesy .
it's easier this way .
it's easy if you try .
it's easy to see why .
it's good to be home .
it's hard to believe .
it's made of leather .
it's noisy next door .
it's not a bad thing .
it's not a classroom .
it's not about money .
it's not always easy .
it's not evening yet .
it's not fair at all .
it's not fair to you .
it's not good enough .
it's not just a game .
it's not my birthday .
it's not my business .
it's not on the menu .
it's not predictable .
it's not raining yet .
it's not their fault .
it's not time to die .
it's nothing special .
it's older than that .
it's only a painting .
it's over between us .
it's over now , right ?
it's perfectly legal .
it's really horrible .
it's right above you .
it's right next door .
it's sort of strange .
it's still not ready .
it's still not right .
it's still too early .
it's time for dinner .
it's time for school .
it's time to go home .
it's too late anyway .
it's too late for me .
it's very surprising .
it's what i would do .
it's what he painted .
italy is a peninsula .
just close your eyes .
just get out of here .
justice will prevail .
keep the door closed .
keep the door locked .
keep the kids inside .
keep your eye on him .
keep your nose clean .
leave my stuff alone .
let go of the bottle .
let go of the handle .
let me call you back .
let me deal with him .
let me get my wallet .
let me see that list .
let me take a gander .
let me try something .

is everything all right at home ?
is it a compliment or an insult ?
is lunch included in this price ?
is someone knocking on the door ?
is something bothering you , tom ?
is something else going on here ?
is that supposed to cheer me up ?
is that what you want me to say ?
is that why you want to hurt me ?
is that why you want to kill me ?
is the chairman going to resign ?
is there a hospital around here ?
is there an information counter ?
is there anybody else i can ask ?
is there anything i should know ?

it is a pity that he can't come .
it is difficult for me to skate .
it is extraordinarily hot today .
it is getting darker and darker .
it is getting warmer and warmer .
it is getting warmer day by day .
it is high time you went to bed .
it is high time you were in bed .
it is rare for him to get angry .
it is really quite a good story .
it is said the house is haunted .
it is ten minutes before eleven .
it is terribly hot this morning .
it is time for you to go to bed .
it is very cold today , isn't it ?
it isn't something i want to do .
it isn't worthwhile going there .

it may be that he likes his job .
it may well rain before tonight .
it occurred to me spontaneously .

it seems that he knows about it .
it used to be nearly impossible .
it was a bitter pill to swallow .
it was a warm , friendly meeting .
it was an ideal day for walking .

it's hard to speak english well .
it's hard to steal from a thief .
it's heavy , but i can manage it .
it's ideal weather for a picnic .
it's important that i hear this .
it's like being in a candy shop .
it's more complicated than that .
it's no use asking me for money .
it's not about the money , is it ?
it's not an either - or situation .
it's not for the faint of heart .
it's nothing short of a miracle .
it's nothing to get upset about .
it's possible , but not probable .
it's true that he saw a monster .
it's two o'clock in the morning .
it's unlike him to get so angry .
it's very kind of you to say so .
it's warm for this time of year .
japanese is harder than english .
